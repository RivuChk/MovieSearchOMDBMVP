# MovieSearch - OMDB - MVP
## Prepared for my talk: https://youtu.be/h6g0T7CQbcY as an example on how to structure your project with MVP Architecture patterns in Android
- I strictly discourage you to use this repository as your template, it was meant for easy understanding on how to structure your code, many things in this repo are not standard, for example: gradle build files. However, you can refer to this repo if you want to learn/brush up on MVP architecture / how to setup data layer properly etc. If you want an template, I suggest trying either of this ones by me (uses MVI + Clean)
